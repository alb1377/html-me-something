                <p>
                    I enjoy creating and learning to make things. Creating art, for me, provides an outlet. 
                    I find it relaxing and challenging. Therefore, I would like to relay a little bit of what 
                    I enjoy, and what sort of things I prefer using or would like to try.

                <h2>Art Mediums</h2>
                <p>
                    There are a variety of art mediums available to choose from for the beginner or the advanced artist. 
                    I usually work with canvas, watercolor paper, or sketchpad for my drawings. I'd really like to get into 
                    working with wood as a medium, on both a large and small scale.

                <h2>Drawing</h2>
                <p>In most art projects, you are typically lightly sketching your subject/object onto your art medium.
                 I very much enjoy drawing in pencil and charcoal. I draw on a smaller scale more often than not. I started
                 out creating abstract works, but enjoy scenery sketches the most.

                <h2>Painting</h2>
                <p> There are a variety of different kinds of paint you can use. Such as: Acrylic, Oil, and Watercolor. I like 
                    painting in acrylic and watercolor the most. I find myself more often painting with acrylic paint than anything 
                    else. I find it easier to maintain shapes along with layering to give it depth along with a wider color range. Watercolor 
                    I find challenging because its hard to maintain distinction between objects and to get more vibrant colors.
