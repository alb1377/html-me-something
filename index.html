                    I enjoy creating and learning to make things. Creating art, for me, provides an outlet. I find it relaxing and challenging. Therefore, 
                    I would like to relay a little bit of what I enjoy, and what sort of things I prefer
                    using or would like to try.

                <p>
                    There are a variety of art mediums available to choose from for the beginner or the advanced artist. I usually work with canvas,
                    watercolor paper, or sketchpad for my drawings. I'd really like to get into working with wood as a medium, on both a large and 
                    scale.

                <p>In most art projects, you are typically lightly sketching your subject/object onto to your art medium.
                 I very much enjoy drawing in pencil and charcoal. I draw on a smaller scale more often than not. I started out creating abstract works,
                 but enjoy scenery sketches the most.

                <p> There are a variety of different kinds of paint you can use. Such as: Acrylic, Oil, and Watercolor. I like 
                    painting in acrylic and watercolor the most. I find myself more often painting with acrylic paint than anything else. I find
                    it easier to maintain shapes and to layer to give it depth along with a wider color range.
                    Watercolor I find challenging because its hard to maintain distinction between objects and to get more vibrant colors.
